# K-Means clustering Algorithm

## Part one: K-Means from scratch
In this part, the K-Means clustering algorithm is implemented.
It is implemented from scratch and without using ML libraries. 
I also evaluated my implementation by generating bulbs and 
clustering them using the algorithm.


## Part two: Clustering the Iris dataset
In the second part, I used the K-Means algorithm from the scikit
learn library to cluster Iris Dataset.
